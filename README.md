# Introduction
Welcome to my project, where you can explore the fascinating world of graph algorithms through interactive visualizations. I had a lot of fun programming this project and I hope you'll enjoy using it too.

Graph algorithms are used in many fields, from computer networking to social media analysis, and they help us understand the relationships and connections between different entities. However, these algorithms can be complex and difficult to grasp without a visual representation.

That's why I created this website, to provide an intuitive and engaging way to learn about graph algorithms. With our interactive visualizations, you can see how these algorithms work in real-time, adjust the parameters, and observe the results.

Whether you're a student studying computer science, a researcher exploring the latest developments in graph theory, or just someone curious about the world of algorithms, this website has something for everyone. So come and explore, and have fun while learning!

# Features 
* Select algorithms: Users can choose from different graph algorithms to visualize, such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm or A Star.
* Adjust visualization speed: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to suit their preferences.
* Move nodes and graph: Users can move nodes and the entire graph around the screen by dragging them with their mouse.
* Zoom in and out: Users can zoom in and out of the graph by scrolling up or down with their mouse.
* Reset graph: Users can reset the graph to its original state by clicking the reset button.
* Delete nodes and edges: Users can delete nodes and edges by selecting them and clicking the delete button.
* Generate random graph: Users can generate a graph with a specified number of nodes and edges randomly.
* Create nodes and edges: Users can create nodes and edges on the graph by clicking and dragging their mouse.
* Select start and end nodes: Users can select the start and end nodes for the graph algorithm by clicking on the corresponding nodes.

# Technologies Used
